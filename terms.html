                <p class="mbr-header__subtext"><br><br><br>HallandCoTrading.com (referred to herein as “Hall &amp; Co Trading”, “we” or “us”) and its Affiliates (defined below) provide certain free and paid for training, educational, and market information services through its web site located at www.HallandCoTrading.com (the “Site”) and via email, text or other delivery methods (“Services”). In consideration of Hall &amp; Co Trading (or any of its Affiliates) providing, or continuing to provide, you (you may be referred to herein as “you” or “user”) with access to the Site and the Services, you hereby agree that your use of this Site and any Service shall be expressly pursuant to and conditioned upon your agreement to the following Terms and Conditions (“Terms”).1. 
<br>
<br>Acknowledgement of Disclosures and Disclaimers
<br>
<br>1. You hereby acknowledge and agree that:
<br>
<br>Neither Hall &amp; Co Trading nor any of its owners, directors, officers, employees, agents, independent contractors or affiliates (collectively “Affiliates”) are registered as an investment adviser. Rather Hall &amp; Co Trading and its Affiliates rely upon the “publisher’s exclusion” from the definition of “investment adviser” as provided under Section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and corresponding state securities laws. The Site and Services are bona fide publications of general and regular circulation offering impersonalized investment-related information to users and/or prospective users (e.g., not tailored to the specific investment needs of current and/or prospective users). To the extent any of the content published as part of the Site or Services may be deemed to be investment advice, such information is impersonal and not tailored to the investment needs of any specific person.
<br>We will not evaluate your individual financial condition, investment portfolio, investment experience, age, income, tax bracket, risk tolerance, investment objectives or other similar factors (referred to herein as “Individual Financial Requirements”).
<br>The Site and Services are currently limited to the dissemination of impersonal investment-related information pertaining to Hall &amp; Co Trading’s “technically-based” analyses, together with access to additional impersonal investment-related information and links. By its nature, technically-based analysis does not contemplate the user’s Individual Financial Requirements.
<br>The Site and Services do not offer and users do not receive initial or ongoing individual personalized investment advice, investment reporting, investment supervisory or investment management services, nor the ongoing review or monitoring of the user’s individual investment portfolio. Rather, the Site and Services are designed solely to provide users with a method to identify and evaluate potential opportunities and obtain information on market analysis, current events, trade methodology, and other related information. Therefore, each user hereby agrees that use of the Site or any Service is not a substitute for ongoing individual personalized advice from an investment professional of the user’s choosing.
<br>Each user hereby agrees that he/she/it should independently evaluate and determine whether to act upon any information provided through the Site or Services (including without limitation, individual “picks”, recommendations or trends) based on the user’s Individual Financial Requirements. Further, each user hereby acknowledges that neither Hall &amp; Co Trading nor any of its Affiliates will advise you personally concerning the nature, potential or suitability of any particular trend, security, portfolio of securities, transaction, investment strategy or other similar matter.
<br>Certain portions of the Site and certain Services (i.e. newsletters, articles, commentaries, etc.) may contain a discussion of, and/or provide access to, positions of Hall &amp; Co Trading or its Affiliates and/or their “picks,” trades, or recommendations. Due to various factors, including, but not limited to, changing market conditions, such position, discussion, pick or recommendation may only be valid for a specific moment in time (day, hour, minute or tick of the tape). Thus, each user hereby agrees to independently evaluate and determine whether to act upon any such information. Moreover, no user or prospective user should assume that any such discussion serves as the receipt of, or a substitute for, individual personalized advice from an investment professional of his/her/its choosing.
<br>You acknowledge that news, information and performance data available through the Site or any Service is supplied by sources believed to be reliable but that Hall &amp; Co Trading undertakes no responsibility to verify the accuracy or completeness of such information or to update such information. Further, the Site or Services may contain trades, recommendations, opinions, news or information which are incomplete or dated. As markets change continuously, previously published recommendations, news information and data may not be current and should not be relied upon.
<br>To the extent that the Site or any Service contains a “model portfolio”, such model portfolio is to be construed as developed based upon a particular investment strategy but not developed for any user’s Individual Financial Requirements. Further, the actual results of the portfolio, as well as a user’s actual results may differ substantially from the stated investment strategy.
<br>Past performance may not be indicative of future results. Therefore, no current or prospective user should assume that the future performance of any trend, pick, recommendation, specific investment, investment strategy, product or service made or referenced directly or indirectly through the Site or Services will be profitable or otherwise provide equal historical or anticipated performance level(s).
<br>Different types of currencies, securities and investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific currency, security, investment or investment strategy referenced directly or indirectly through the Site or Services will be suitable for a user’s and/or prospective user’s investment portfolio.
<br>You acknowledge and agree that the Site and Services may contain picks, recommendations or trends that may be different from those obtained through other portions of the Site or other Services and that Hall &amp; Co Trading or its Affiliates and third party service providers may, from time to time, have long and short positions in, or buy or sell the currencies, securities, or derivatives thereof, of companies referenced through the Site or Services and may take positions inconsistent with the views expressed through the Site or Services.
<br>You acknowledge and agree that certain Hall &amp; Co Trading Affiliates may discuss or recommend specific currencies, securities or investment strategies in which they or their firms have a position, and that they may trade for their own account. In cases where the position is held at the time of publication, Hall &amp; Co Trading will endeavor to make appropriate disclosures. However, due to the short term nature of the investment and trading activities of such Affiliates, such disclosure may not be possible, or feasible. Therefore, you understand and agree that at the time of any transaction that you make, one or more of Hall &amp; Co Trading’s Affiliates may have an undisclosed position in the currencies or securities referenced. Hall &amp; Co Trading makes no representations regarding the strategies or individual currencies positions of any third party service provider.
<br>To the extent that any user or prospective user utilizes any investment “filtering software”, economic, financial or retirement “calculator” or similar device (collectively referred to as “Software”) contained within or linked to the Site or referenced in any Service, the user or prospective user acknowledges and understands that the information resulting from the use of any such Software should not be construed, in any manner whatsoever, as the receipt of personalized investment advice from Hall &amp; Co Trading, its affiliates or any third party service provider and should not be considered a substitute for individual personalized advice from an investment professional of his/her/its choosing.
<br>The actual results of any pick, recommendation, investment or investment strategy will vary depending on execution time, speed and quality, market liquidity, commissions and other fees, and general market conditions and volatility.
<br>Hall &amp; Co Trading and its Affiliates do not possess and do not desire any material non-public information regarding any currency or company. Such information will not be provided or accepted by Hall &amp; Co Trading or any of its Affiliates.
<br>Hall &amp; Co Trading and its Affiliates do not offer or provide investment implementation services.
<br>The Site and Services do not establish a fiduciary relationship.
<br>The publication of the Site or Services should not be construed by any user and/or prospective user as a solicitation to effect, or attempt to effect transactions in currencies or securities by any person or entity.
<br>Hall &amp; Co Trading may suggest affiliated or third party service providers through the Site or Services and/or provide user information to affiliated or third party service providers. Hall &amp; Co Trading may receive a fee from such affiliated or third party service providers. While Hall &amp; Co Trading may review the products and services of any such recommended affiliated or third party service provider, users and/or prospective users hereby agree to determine for themselves whether any such recommended service provider is appropriate for his/her/its individual circumstances prior to the engagement thereof. Hall &amp; Co Trading does not make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy, timeliness, suitability, completeness, or relevance of any information prepared by any affiliated or unaffiliated third party service provider, whether linked to the Site or incorporated therein, and takes no responsibility therefor. All such information is provided solely for convenience purposes only and all users thereof should be guided accordingly.
<br>Third Party Service Providers and Information
<br>The Site and/or Services may contain links, references or recommendations to third party services providers. Your use or purchase of any product or service provided by a third party service provider is governed by the terms, conditions and rules imposed by such third party service provider and not by Hall &amp; Co Trading’s Terms. By using any service you are acknowledging that you have reviewed all such terms, conditions and rules and agree to be bound by them. Further, you hereby agree to look only to such third party provider for the provision of such product or service or for satisfaction of any claim you may have related to such product or service. You acknowledge and agree that Hall &amp; Co Trading and its Affiliates shall not be held responsible for the legality, accuracy, or inappropriate nature of any third party product or service or for any loss or damages caused or alleged to have been caused by the use of such product or service.
<br>
<br>The Site or Services may contain links, references or recommendations to information, and/or opinions of third parties. We do not control such third parties nor necessarily endorse any such information or opinions, nor have we reviewed or approved any such content. You acknowledge and agree that Hall &amp; Co Trading, and its Affiliates shall not be held responsible for the legality, accuracy, or inappropriate nature of any content, advertising, products, services, or information provided by any third party, nor for any loss or damages caused or alleged to have been caused by the use of or reliance on any such content.
<br>
<br>You expressly acknowledge and agree that your use of any third party product, service, information or opinion is solely at your risk.
<br>
<br>Disclaimer of Warranties
<br>The Site, Services, and any content, product, news, pick, recommendation, information or other data or service contained or referenced therein, or accessed through the Site or Service, is provided “as is” and without representations or warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, Hall &amp; Co Trading and its Affiliates disclaim all warranties, express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, and all warranties relating to the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of any information available through the Site or any Service.

<br>
<br>Membership Options &amp; Payment Plans
<br>Hall &amp; Co Trading offers its products and services via the Hall &amp; Co Trading Membership. Hall &amp; Co Trading Memberships are sold as a monthly, quarterly, or annual subscription. When you submit an order for any one of the previously mentioned subscription plans, you authorize Hall &amp; Co Trading to automatically process future payments on your account according to the price and billing period indicated on the order form you submitted. The Hall &amp; Co Trading Membership service is billed in advance using the credit card information we have on file for your account, and payments will continue to be processed on your account until you discontinue your membership in accordance with our cancellation policy.
<br>
<br>Cancellation Policy
<br>There are no contracts or mandatory minimum commitments with any of our membership plans. You are free to cancel your membership at any time. If the time comes that you need to discontinue your membership you can do so by sending an email to Support@HallandCoTrading.com. To ensure that your cancellation is processed before your membership automatically renews, we encourage you to submit your cancellation request at least one business day prior to your renewal date. We do not offer refunds for cancellations processed after your payment has already been captured. Cancellation requests that are submitted in the middle of your pay period will be processed when received, and any/all recurring payments associated with your request will be made inactive immediately. Your access to the Hall &amp; Co Trading membership website will remain active throughout the remainder of your pay period, but Hall &amp; Co Trading cannot offer refunds or apply credits to your account for any time remaining on services already paid for.
<br>
<br>Refund Policy
<br>Our refund policy is very simple…we don’t offer them. You are in the business of trading, and at Hall &amp; Co Trading we treat your order the same way the market would; meaning once your order has been placed and your payment has been processed, there is no turning back, even if things don’t turn out how you expected. If that scares you, or if you have any inclination that our products or services are not right for you, then please do not submit your order. If you have any questions about what we offer, or if you need further clarification about what your purchase will include, then please don’t hesitate to contact us at (Support@HallandCoTrading.com), we are happy to answer your questions and help in any way that we can.
<br>
<br>The truth is our refund policy is strict because we want to promote professionalism in every interaction we have with our clients. Just as we encourage you to perform your due diligence, assess your personal situation, and make an informed decision before you place a trade, we also encourage you to do the same when making the decision to join the community here at Hall &amp; Co Trading. We give everything we have to help traders succeed, and if we’re going to devote that level of energy and effort then we want to ensure that it’s directed towards individuals who are serious about their future and committed to their success! If that’s not you, then that’s ok. We understand that our services may not be suited for everyone.
<br>
<br>Likewise, as much as we would enjoy the opportunity to work with you, if your financial situation that has you worried about paying your rent, if you’re having to take on debt just to feed your family, or if you’re concerned about being able to afford your medication next month, then we must ask that you resist the temptation to sign up for our services. The last thing we want to do is reply to your email, where you explain your unfortunate financial circumstance and ask for a refund, by sending you a link to this page with a simple note that says “…sorry.” So please don’t put yourself in that awkward situation.
<br>
<br>Other

No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading, caption or section title contained in the Terms is inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof.

<br>
<br>
<br>Disclaimer
<br>
<br>Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment. If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you initially deposited into your account, therefore, you should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss, and you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Risk Disclosure
<br>
<br>Decisions to buy, sell, hold or trade in securities, commodities and other investments involve risk and are best made based on the advice of qualified financial professionals. Any trading in securities or other investments involves a risk of substantial losses. Generally foreign securities, options, futures and currency transactions involve exposure to a combination of the following risk factors: market risk, credit risk, settlement risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and legal risk. There can be serious market disruptions if economic or political or other unforeseen events locally or overseas affect the market.  The practice of “Day Trading” involves particularly high risks and can cause you to lose substantial sums of money. Before undertaking any trading program, you should consult a qualified financial professional. Please consider carefully whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition and ability to bear financial risks.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Electronic Trading Risks
<br>
<br>Before you engage in transactions using an electronic system, you should carefully review the rules and regulations of the exchanges offering the system and/or listing the instruments you intend to trade. Online trading has inherent risk due to system response and access times that may vary due to market conditions, system performance, and other factors. You should understand these and additional risks before trading.

To ensure that your cancellation is processed before your membership automatically renews, we encourage you to submit your cancellation request at least one business day prior to your renewal date. We do not offer refunds for cancellations processed after your payment has already been captured. Cancellation requests that are submitted in the middle of your pay period will be processed when received, and any/all recurring payments associated with your request will be made inactive immediately.

<br>
<br>Refund Policy
<br>Our refund policy is very simple…we don’t offer them. You are in the business of trading, and at Hall &amp; Co Trading we treat your order the same way the market would; meaning once your order has been placed and your payment has been processed, there is no turning back, even if things don’t turn out how you expected. If that scares you, or if you have any inclination that our products or services are not right for you, then please do not submit your order. If you have any questions about what we offer, or if you need further clarification about what your purchase will include, then please don’t hesitate to contact us at (Support@HallandCoTrading.com), we are happy to answer your questions and help you in any way that we can.
<br>
<br>The truth is our refund policy is strict because we want to promote professionalism in every interaction we have with our clients. Just as we encourage you to perform your due diligence, assess your personal situation, and make an informed decision before you place a trade, we also encourage you to do the same when making the decision to join the community here at Hall &amp; Co Trading. We give everything we have to help traders succeed, and if we’re going to devote that level of energy and effort then we want to ensure that it’s directed towards individuals who are serious about their future and committed to their success! If that’s not you, then that’s ok. We understand that our services may not be suited for everyone.
<br>
<br>Likewise, as much as we would enjoy the opportunity to work with you, if your financial situation that has you worried about paying your rent, if you’re having to take on debt just to feed your family, or if you’re concerned about being able to afford your medication next month, then we must ask that you resist the temptation to sign up for our services. The last thing we want to do is reply to your email, where you explain your unfortunate financial circumstance and ask for a refund, by sending you a link to this page with a simple note that says “…sorry.” So please don’t put yourself in that awkward situation.
